# Gizmo AI - Scope Lock Agreement

## 🔒 **SCOPE LOCKED - MVP PHASE**

**Date**: [Current Date]  
**Status**: **LOCKED** ✅  
**Phase**: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)  
**Next Gate**: MVP completion with all success criteria met

---

## 🚫 **Scope Lock Rules**

### **MVP Phase - NO EXCEPTIONS**
- **NO scope changes** without unanimous agreement (you + any reviewer)
- **NO new features** until all MVP items are complete
- **NO template additions** beyond React, Express, Flask
- **NO performance optimizations** beyond basic requirements
- **Focus**: Make the three showcase tasks work perfectly

### **Scope Change Process**
1. **Proposal**: Document the proposed change with justification
2. **Impact Analysis**: Assess impact on MVP timeline and success criteria
3. **Unanimous Agreement**: You + reviewer must both approve
4. **Documentation**: Update this file with the decision and rationale
5. **Implementation**: Only proceed after agreement is documented

## 🎯 **Locked MVP Scope**

### **Core Functionality (LOCKED)**
- [ ] **Planner Agent**: Generate structured development plans
- [ ] **Coder Agent**: Implement code changes via unified diffs
- [ ] **Tester Agent**: Run tests and validate implementations
- [ ] **Orchestrator**: Coordinate agent workflow and state management
- [ ] **Sandbox**: Secure, network-isolated execution environment
- [ ] **Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring with timeline and diff viewer

### **Showcase Tasks (LOCKED)**
- [ ] **React Template**: Add division + divide-by-zero guard
- [ ] **Express Template**: Add `/healthz` + test
- [ ] **Flask Template**: Add `/sum` + test

### **Success Criteria (LOCKED)**
- [ ] **First event ≤ 5 seconds** after task start
- [ ] **Curated showcase runs pass ≥80%** of the time
- [ ] **Downloadable diffs and logs** for each run
- [ ] **Replay functionality** works without new LLM calls

---

## 🚀 **Post-MVP (Future - Not Now)**

### **Enhanced Agents**
- [ ] **Reviewer Agent**: Code review and quality checks
- [ ] **Agent Learning**: Improve based on success/failure patterns
- [ ] **Custom Prompts**: User-configurable agent behaviors

### **Integration & Deployment**
- [ ] **GitHub Integration**: Create PRs, handle webhooks
- [ ] **Authentication**: User roles and permissions
- [ ] **Multi-tenant**: Support multiple projects/teams
- [ ] **Production Deployment**: Scalable infrastructure

### **Advanced Features**
- [ ] **Template Library**: More framework/language support
- [ ] **Custom Tasks**: User-defined task types
- [ ] **Analytics**: Success rates, performance metrics
- [ ] **Collaboration**: Team workflows and sharing

## ✅ **Definition of Done - MVP**

### **MVP Complete When**
1. **All three showcase tasks pass consistently** (≥80% success rate)
2. **First agent event appears within 5 seconds**
3. **Diffs and logs are downloadable** for each run
4. **Replay functionality works** without LLM calls
5. **Sandbox security is verified** (no network access, command allowlist enforced)
6. **Dashboard shows real-time progress** and artifacts

### **MVP Success Metrics**
- **Performance**: First event ≤ 5s, P95 completion < 90s
- **Reliability**: ≥80% success rate on curated tasks
- **Security**: Zero sandbox escapes, network isolation maintained
- **Usability**: Downloadable artifacts, replay functionality
