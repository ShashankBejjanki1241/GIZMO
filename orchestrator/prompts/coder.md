INPUT: JSON with keys { "plan": <planner JSON>, "repo": { "root": string, "files": [string,...] } }

OUTPUT:
- A single **unified diff** patch to implement the NEXT subtask only.
- End with a single line: `COMMIT: <short message>`

Rules:
- Minimal, reversible changes. Do not modify configs unless required.
- Do not delete critical files (package.json or lockfiles).
- No text outside the diff and final COMMIT line.
