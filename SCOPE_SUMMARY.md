# Gizmo AI - Scope Summary

## 🔒 **SCOPE STATUS: LOCKED** ✅

**Phase**: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)  
**Objective**: Lock scope, avoid churn, make Cursor/AI help you (not fight you)

---

## 🎯 **Locked MVP Scope**

### **Core Functionality**
- [ ] **Planner Agent**: Generate structured development plans
- [ ] **Coder Agent**: Implement code changes via unified diffs  
- [ ] **Tester Agent**: Run tests and validate implementations
- [ ] **Orchestrator**: Coordinate agent workflow and state management
- [ ] **Sandbox**: Secure, network-isolated execution environment
- [ ] **Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring with timeline and diff viewer

### **Showcase Tasks (Demo Requirements)**
- [ ] **React**: Add division + divide-by-zero guard
- [ ] **Express**: Add `/healthz` + test
- [ ] **Flask**: Add `/sum` + test

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] **First event ≤ 5 seconds** after task start
- [ ] **Curated runs pass ≥80%** of the time
- [ ] **Downloadable diffs/logs** for each run
- [ ] **Replay works** without new LLM calls

## 🚫 **Scope Lock Rules**

### **NO EXCEPTIONS for MVP**
- **NO scope changes** without unanimous agreement (you + reviewer)
- **NO new features** until all MVP items complete
- **NO template additions** beyond React, Express, Flask
- **Focus**: Make three showcase tasks work perfectly

---

## 📋 **Three Buckets Only**

### 🚀 **MVP** (Current Focus)
- Core functionality + three showcase tasks
- Success criteria achievement
- Sandbox security and isolation

### 🔮 **Post-MVP** (Future)
- Enhanced agents, GitHub integration
- Authentication, multi-tenant support
- Production deployment

### 🧊 **Icebox** (Future Planning)
- Multi-language support, cloud integration
- Mobile development, enterprise features
- No development resources allocated

## 🔍 **Quick Reference**

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `BACKLOG.md` | Complete backlog with three buckets |
| `SHOWCASE_TASKS.md` | Detailed task definitions |
| `SCOPE_LOCK_AGREEMENT.md` | Formal scope lock agreement |
| `PROJECT_INDEX.md` | Complete project structure |

---

## ✅ **Next Gate**

**MVP completion** with all success criteria met:
1. All three showcase tasks pass consistently
2. Performance targets achieved
3. Security verified
4. Dashboard functional

---

## 🚀 **Immediate Actions**

1. **Review scope lock** - understand what's locked
2. **Focus on showcase tasks** - no scope expansion
3. **Use Cursor rules** - follow established guidelines
4. **Track progress** - measure against success criteria
